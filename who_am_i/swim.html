    <p>I started swimming when I was really young, and somewhere along the way it turned from just another activity into something I truly care about. Over the years, swimming has become more than just a sport; it's a routine, a challenge, and a part of who I am.</p>

    <p>I currently swim for the Bellevue Club Swim Team in the Senior Prep group. Practices are tough, but they've taught me discipline and how to stay committed to long-term goals. I've grown a lot through the challenges, and it's made me mentally and physically stronger.</p>

    <p>I've learned how to push through pain, focus under pressure, and keep going even when it's hard. Whether it's a long meet weekend or an early morning practice, I always walk away feel better than when I started.</p>
