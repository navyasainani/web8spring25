    <p>Everyone has personal interests that make life more enjoyable, and for me, a lot of that comes down to music, TV shows, and spending time with friends. I'm always listening to something, whether I'm studying, walking, or just relaxing. I like artists like Drake, SZA, The Weeknd and Travis Scott. I just enjoy their music; the sound, and how it makes everything feel better. I also really enjoy watching TV, especially shows that are long and have a lot of seasons. I like being able to stay with the same characters and storylines over time. Some of my favorite series are Gossip Girl, Grey's Anatomy, Breaking Bad, Ginny & Georgia, Stranger Things, and The Summer I Turned Pretty. Outside of that, I like scrolling on TikTok, FaceTiming my friends, and just relaxing after school or swim. These might seem like small things, but they're part of how I unwind and enjoy everyday life. Between classes, homework, and practices, it's nice to have things I can look forward to that make me feel better.</p>
